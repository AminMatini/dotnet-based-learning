# My .NET Learning Journey

This repository is a log of my progress as I learn and improve my .NET skills. 
<br/>
I am documenting my journey to keep track of my progress and to share my experiences with others.
<br/>
Now that I am creating this repository, I have two years of programming experience 
<br/>
It suddenly occurred to me to document my learning and even review my previous learning through documentation.
